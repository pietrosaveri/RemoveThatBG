# RemoveThatBG!

## About the App

Have you ever had to do a PowerPoint or a presentation where you needed an image, but it had a horrible background?
You probably went on Google and typed "image background removal," and yes, a lot of sites are there, they work great, but wait—
you have to first decide which site, then you probably get flash-banged by lots of ads, and when you can finally edit your image, WAIT, login! Don’t want to login?
You can only download it in 240p.

I hated that. It takes too long, and I don’t want to lose quality. I wanted something quick, easy to reach, always ready when I needed it the most.
Enter **RemoveThatBG!**, a standalone app that lives rent-free in your top bar menu on your Mac—you won’t even notice it’s there! But when you need it, it’s ready for action, always waiting for you.
Just open it and drag and drop (or paste) any image, even WebP! From anywhere—Finder, Google, WhatsApp—and wait just a few seconds (actually a bit more; I’m still working on the Python-Swift interaction, but hey, I will fix it).
And BOOM! In just a couple of little seconds (as I said, more, but let me have fun), your image will be ready. From now on, it’s pretty easy: you can copy or drag it wherever you want.
Have fun!!

**High-Quality Output:** Maintains original image resolution and quality.

**Model Selection:**
	- The default model is **u2netp.onnx** (the lightest, fastest to download, and works offline immediately). However, it is not the best in terms of background removal quality.

	- Choose from a range of state-of-the-art models for portraits, anime, high-res, and more. All models are stored locally for fast, offline use.

**Design Customization:** Personalize your experience with animation and design settings.

**Open Source:** Powered by [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) and modern SwiftUI.
